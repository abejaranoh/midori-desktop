# nora

## Setup

1. install `nodejs@lts`, `pnpm`

the Node.js's version is assumed to use "20.x" or "22.x"

## How to apply changes

1. run `pnpm build` in /floorp/nora/

2. run `mach build` or `mach build faster` in root

that's it!

If you want to run build without typing `pnpm build`, you can use the watch mode

1. run `pnpm dev` in /floorp/nora/

2. launch new console

3. run `mach build` or `mach build faster` in root in new console
